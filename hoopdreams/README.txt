Notes about the alpha release:

- The basic framwork for all the screens has been laid out to make their development a lot quicker. 
- The Create screeen is done, but is bottlenecked by the data model which is still in the progress of being defined. 
- The find page queries the data model and would list the games in the tables, but the data model is yet to be implemented.
- Having problems with gps data in simulator until you go to Debug > Location > and set a value.
- RSVP and Settings are yet to be coded out but the UI is done an viewable.
- The splash screen is yet to be shown, but it's design is completed in storyboard.
- At this stage, the general organization of the project is done which will make further developement much quicker.
